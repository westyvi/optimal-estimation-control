# optimal-estimation-control
This is a repository to hold my projects for AEM 566, Optimal Estimation and Control, at the University of Alabama. Projects all contain a P#.py file (where # is the project number) that produces the project results when run. Projects are as follows:

P1: LQR design for a Rendezvous and Proximity Operation (RPO)
P2: Stochastic,  second-order Markov Model for gust simulation
P3: Nonlinear least squares estimation of battery parameters
